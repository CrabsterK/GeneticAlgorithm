# GeneticAlgorithm
The aim of the task was to get acquainted with metaheuristics of genetic algorithms by an implementation. 
The genetic algorithm is a metaheuristics inspired by the process of natural selection.
To apply it, there were defined: selection, mutation, crossing and evaluation of the quality of the solution
(evaluation function).
